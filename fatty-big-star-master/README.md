Our game for CS113 Fall '14! 

###Style Guide:

- All HTML files (files with a `.html` or `.htm` extension) must be
indented with 2 spaces (not tabs)

- All Javascript and CSS files (files ending with a `.js` or `.css` extension) must be indented
with 4 spaces (not tabs).

- All static files (in our case this is everything except for index.html) should go inside the `/static` directory and then into the file's appropriate subdirectory.
